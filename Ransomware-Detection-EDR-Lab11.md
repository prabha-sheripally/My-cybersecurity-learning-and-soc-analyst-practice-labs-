# Ransomware Detection via EDR - Lab 11
> Threat Type: Ransomware Execution and Containment (Detected by EDR)
- Alert Source: CrowdStrike Falcon / SentinelOne
- Host: `FINANCE-PC01`
- Detected File: `invoice_update.exe`
- Behavior: File encryption activity, creation of `.locked` extensions
- Ransom Note Dropped: `README_RECOVER.txt`
- Severity: Critical
## üîç Investigation Steps:
1. Received alert from EDR tool for suspicious encryption activity
2. Observed parent process: `invoice_update.exe` executed via email attachment
3. Verified process tree ‚Äì used PowerShell to drop files and disable shadow copies
4. EDR flagged behavior: mass file rename, registry changes, backup deletion
5. Located dropped ransom note with instructions and bitcoin address
6. Checked network connections ‚Äì found C2 beacon attempts
7. Isolated the host from the network to contain the spread
## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used:
- CrowdStrike Falcon / SentinelOne
- EDR Process Tree Analysis
- File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)
- VirusTotal for hash analysis
- SIEM to check lateral movement
## ‚úÖ Outcome:
- Host isolated and re-imaged
- IOC hashes added to threat feed
- Email attachment source blocked at email gateway
- User retrained on phishing awareness
## üß† Summary:
This lab shows how EDR tools help detect and contain ransomware by analyzing file behavior, process tree, and system-level changes. It highlights the importance of early detection and quick response.
